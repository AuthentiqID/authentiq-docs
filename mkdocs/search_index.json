Alternatively you can point your \nfavourite OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect client library\n at Authentiq.\n\n\nAs we run Authentiq Connect as a Service, there is no need to install or run anything locally.\n\n\nSoon you will also be able to \ninstall the Authentiq Connect daemon locally\n, from source, or using pre-built packages for Debian 7.0, 8.0 and Ubuntu 15.04.\n\n\nShow me the code!\n\n\nRegister an app\n and paste the following code into an HTML page at the point where you want render a Sign in button.

The app creates and maintains a mobile identity\nAuthentiq ID\nthat can be used to authenticate. An Authentiq ID can be seen as a secure cryptographic passport that can hold various bits of profile information. Some of the information, like phone number and email address, are verified by Authentiq so that the website doesn\nt have to. The user still decides what to share and with whom.\n\n\nApplication types\n\n\nTBD\n\n\nScopes\n\n\nAuthentiq Connect leverages OAuth 2.0 scopes to specify what sections of a user\ns profile are being requested, inheriting \nscopes from OIDC\n where possible.\n\n\nIdentity claims\n\n\nUsing scopes, a client application can request the following \nidentity claims\n from a user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScope name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nClaims included\n\n\nCan be marked required?\n\n\nCan be signed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nA user\ns full name.\n\n\nname\n, \ngiven_name\n, \nfamily_name\n, \nmiddle_name\n, \nnickname\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemail\n\n\nA user\ns (verified) email address\n\n\nemail\n, \nemail_verified\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphone\n\n\nA user\ns (verified) phone number\n\n\nphone_number\n, \nphone_number_verified\n\n\nYes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\naddress\n\n\nA user\ns home address\n\n\naddress\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlocation\n\n\nA user\ns current location.\n\n\naq:location\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing OIDC, scopes are \noptional\n by default, leaving the choice of providing any of the details to the end-user, who will be able to opt out of the requested scopes on the Authentiq ID consent screen. The client application is then responsible to deal with the missing information.\n\n\nAlternatively, Authentiq allows you to mark certain scopes as \nrequired\n and/or \nrequiring a signature\n from a trusted issuer.\n\n\nRequired claims\n\n\nIdentity scopes can be marked as being \nrequired\n by appending \n~r\n to the scope label, for instance \nemail~r\n or \nphone~r\n. Doing so will prevent a user from opting out of the section when signing in from the Authentiq ID mobile app. We recommend using this flag sparingly and instead letting users opt-in to the information they share with you.\n\n\nSigned claims\n\n\nScopes can also be marked to \nrequire a signature\n from an externally trusted party. In fact, Authentiq is acting as a signature provider for the email and phone claims, handling the confirmation of email addresses and phone number using a one-time verification code sent by email or text message.\n\n\nDevelopers will be able to register their own signature providers soon. \n\n\nFunctional scopes\n\n\nAuthentiq Connect also uses scopes to indicate \nfunctional\n preferences. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naq:push\n\n\nWhether or not to offer \nOne click sign-in\n to the user. With this convenient feature enabled, the end-user will be given the option to skip the QR code for subsequent logins using the same browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors\n\n\nWhen something goes wrong, Authentiq Connect redirects back to the client application as stipulated by OAuth 2.0, so that the error can be handled in the domain and using the UX of the client application. The Authentiq Connect SDK emits these errors in turn as an \nerror\n event.

We already see companies like Amazon and SalesForce making this possible.   \n\n\nAmazon AWS\n\n\nAmazon allows an administrator to configure an external OpenID Connect identity provider as a source for their \nAWS\n console. We\nre planning to supporting this integration at a later stage so that teams will be able to sign in to AWS using their Authentiq ID. \n\n\nAmazon Cognito\n\n\nAmazon allows mobile app developers to configure \nCognito\n with external OpenID Connect identity providers, enabling an app to authenticate users from social networks and a variety of sources. We\nre planning to supporting this integration at a later stage so that mobile app developers will be able to register and authenticate users by their Authentiq ID. \n\n\nSalesForce\n\n\nSalesForce\n allows an administrator configure up an external OpenID Connect identity provider as a source for company employees. We\nre planning to supporting this integration at a later stage so that companies will be able to let their employees sign into SalesForce using their Authentiq ID.\n\n\n\n  .progress-bar-anim {\n    -webkit-transition: width 2.6s ease;\n         -o-transition: width 2.6s ease;\n            transition: width 2.6s ease;\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n  (function(aq, $){\n    // Whole-script strict mode syntax\n    'use strict';\n\n    function generate_button() {\n      var $button = $('#authentiq'),\n          opts = {},\n          button, key, val, text;\n\n      text = $('[data-authentiq-key=\"sign_in_text\"]').val() || 'Sign in';\n\n      $button.replaceWith('<button id=\"authentiq\" class=\"authentiq-button\">' + text + '</button>');\n      $button = $('#authentiq');\n\n      // $button.removeData('authentiq-button');\n\n      $('[data-authentiq-key]').each(function(index){\n        key = $(this).data('authentiq-key');\n        val = $(this).val();\n\n        if (val != '') {\n          opts[key] = val;\n        }\n      });\n\n      button = new authentiq.Button($button[0], opts);\n    }\n\n    function fetch_clients(callback) {\n      var token = JSON.parse(localStorage['ngStorage-authentiq.access_token'] || '{}');\n      if (typeof token.access_token !== 'undefined' && !!token.expires_at && new Date(token.expires_at) > new Date()) {\n\n        var base_url = authentiq._defaults.provider.base_url || 'https://connect.authentiq.io';\n\n        $.ajax({\n          url: base_url + '/client',\n          headers: {\n            'Authorization': token.token_type + ' ' + token.access_token\n          },\n          dataType: 'json'\n        })\n        .done(function(data) {\n          var select = $('#existing-client-id');\n\n          // clear old entries\n          select.html('');\n\n          if (data.length > 0) {\n            $.each(data, function(key, client) {\n              select.append(\n                            $('<option></option>')\n                              .attr('value', client.client_id)\n                              .text(client.client_name));\n            });\n\n            select.prop('disabled', false);\n          } else {\n            select.append(\n                            $('<option></option>')\n                              .attr('value', 'PLACEHOLDER_CLIENT_ID')\n                              .text('No clients found'));\n          }\n\n          if (typeof callback !== 'undefined') {\n            callback();\n          }\n        })\n        .fail(function() {\n          console.info('Clients can\\'t be loaded');\n        });\n      }\n    }\n\n    function console_iframe_loaded() {\n\n      var self = $('#add-client');\n      var iframe = self.find('iframe').contents();\n      var app = iframe.find('#app');\n      self.find('iframe').css('height', app.height());\n\n      app.find('.page-header').hide();\n\n      iframe.find('.progress').hide().find('.progress-bar').width('0%');\n      app.show();\n\n      app.on('click', '#save-button', function(){\n        app.hide();\n        iframe.find('.progress').show().find('.progress-bar').addClass('progress-bar-anim').width('100%');\n        self.find('iframe').css('height', '50px');\n\n        // wait a bit for\n        setTimeout(function() {\n          self.modal('hide');\n\n          self.find('.progress').remove();\n          self.find('.modal-body').children().show();\n\n          fetch_clients(function(){\n            $('#existing-client-id option:last-child').attr('selected', 'selected');\n          });\n        }, 3000);\n      });\n\n      app.on('click', '#cancel-button', function(){\n        self.modal('hide');\n      });\n    };\n    aq.console_iframe_loaded = console_iframe_loaded;\n\n    authentiq.subscribe('profile', function(profile) {\n      $('#add-client-button').removeClass('disabled');\n\n      // redirect iframe to add view\n      $('#add-client iframe')[0].contentWindow.location.hash = '/clients/add';\n\n      fetch_clients();\n    });\n\n    authentiq.subscribe('concluded', function() {\n      $('#existing-client-id').prop('disabled', true);\n      $('#add-client-button').addClass('disabled');\n    });\n\n    $(function() {\n      if (!authentiq.Provider.isSignedIn()) {\n        $('#existing-client-id').prop('disabled', true);\n      }\n\n      $('[data-authentiq-key]').on('change', function(){\n        // handle checkbox options\n        if ($(this).is(':checkbox')) {\n          $(this).val($(this).is(':checked') ?
